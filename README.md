# all-green
A tool made to make your contribution calendar go all green (for fun)

## Description

I  declare that this tool is made entirely for fun and learning some shell. Inappropriate use of this is not to be considered creater's fault.

This tool converts your GitHub contribution calendar to all green. Isn't it amazing ;)

If you are here just for testing purpose, Kindly do it in another GitHub account (probably some secret one) or you can delete that repo later.
